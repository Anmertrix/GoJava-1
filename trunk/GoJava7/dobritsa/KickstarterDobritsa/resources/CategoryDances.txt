“There is a marvelously artisanal quality to Ms. Hansen’s delicately wrought choreography, which takes full account of the notion of live art as something that occurs in a shared space, through the concentrated cooperation of artists and audience members.”

So we embarked on the impossible. Collaborating with the usual six minds in the room, and bringing in three more to the mix, over the past six months. Shift the Grid is coming up on it’s year anniversary and has been selected as the resident artist for Motion Pacific’s Incubator project. We are honored and lucky to have the opportunity as an incredibly young collective, to embark on the journey of putting on our own evening lengths work.
