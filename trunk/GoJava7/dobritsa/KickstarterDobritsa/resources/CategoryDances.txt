So we embarked on the impossible. Collaborating with the usual six minds in the room, and bringing in three more to the mix, over the past six months. Shift the Grid is coming up on it’s year anniversary and has been selected as the resident artist for Motion Pacific’s Incubator project. We are honored and lucky to have the opportunity as an incredibly young collective, to embark on the journey of putting on our own evening lengths work. We are so EXCITED!! And nervous, and unsure and completely making things up as we go along. The aim of the project is to explore our curiosities through contemporary dance, and work in a truly collaborative process in doing so. We wanted to push ourselves to make the entirety of our show together as 6 choreographers, honoring each voice and body in the room.
