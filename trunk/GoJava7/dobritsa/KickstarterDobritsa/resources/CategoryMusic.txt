Forty years ago in 1975, Jerry Chamberlain walked into a professional recording studio for the first time to lay down his initial recorded work as a founding member with Daniel Amos (DA). Since that time, he has played guitar and sung on many artists’ projects, some of those his own (Boy-O-Boy, The Balls Of France), and lent musical support for many recordings. Besides Daniel Amos, Chamberlain has been a long-time member of Swirling Eddies (under the pseudonym of “Spot”). His own songs have surfaced here and there (“Man In The Moon”, “Little Crosses”, etc.), but he has never recorded a solo album. Until now.
